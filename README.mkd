Mineserver2 Mac OS X Distribution Scripts
=========================================

This is a work in progress. Right now it can build the .app and .dmg files
required for a binary distribution from the templates provided... Most of the
time.

If anyone has more experience with this kind of thing, feel free to improve the
process! One thing that would be nice would be removing the requirement to keep
a bunch of binary blobs in the repository and maybe some more error checking in
the scripts themselves.
